    <p>Hello!! I'm super excited to be with yall and learn more about web developing.
       I'm from Mesa, Arizona, born and raised a member as well.
       I'm 21 years old, single, and still got a lot of learning to do. I got to serve an amazing
       mission in Pocatello, Idaho and other southern parts
       of Idaho.</p>
    <p>I love to play video games and I am a total fantasy nerd. I love star wars and
       harry potter as well as marvel. I love technology with a strong passion and hope I can take
       the knowledge I learn in this class into my life more and more.
    </p>
