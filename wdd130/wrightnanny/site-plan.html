        those families that are too busy to call up an agency and have interviews for a nanny that wouldn't be affordable. This page will also show photos

      <h3>Cleaning</h3>
      <p>
        This page will contain information pertaining to the cleaning services hannah offers. Along wiht nannying she likes to help clean around the house even when
        she wasn't expected to clean. She has always had that kind gesture when she nannies, so she thought of the wonderful idea of offering it as a stand-alone service as well.
        This will allow families that have kids that wmay be older and don't need to be babysat a chance to help their busy lifestyles and have someone come and clean and/ or organize.
        This service doesn't have to apply to families and families alone. She has gone and helped out couples who don't have kids and even couples that don't have kids living at home anymore.
