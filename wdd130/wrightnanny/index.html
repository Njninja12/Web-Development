            <h1>The Wright Nanny</h1>
            <p>Are you too busy to keep your house clean and organized? Or have you been wanting a free night and haven't gotten one for months. Well sometimes you just got to find 
                the Wright nanny. My name is Hannah Wright and I started this business to help those families who can't seem to find the time to go to dinner or have a date night because they can't get a nanny or the nanny is too expensive.
                Well I'm here to help relive some of that burden by offering my services of good quality at affordable prices.

        <div class="text">I'm currently going into my senior year at Westwood High School. Volleyball is my life and you will always catch me on the court 
            playing with my school team or my club team. If I'm not on the court, I love to hang out with my friends either at Tempe Marketplace or watching movies.<br>
            I love children and the joy they bring to my life. I have been 
            nannying for close to 3 years now and have loved every second of it.</div>

            <p>I wanted to be a symbol to other people that nanny's don't have to be over the top outrageous prices to be good quality. 
                Nanny should be about taking care of the children and providing care so that the parents may 
                have a lighter load to carry.

            <p>I started a cleaning service once I realized that I like to clean while I babysit. So for the families that have older kids or for 
                times when you don't need a nanny, 
                but don't have the time to clean up or organize, That is why a I started this second service.</p>
