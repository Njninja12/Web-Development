                the Wright nanny. My name is Hannah Wright and I started this business to help those families who can't seem to find the time to go to dinner or have a date night because they can't get a nanny or the nanny is too expensive.
                Well I'm here to help relive some of that burden by offering my services of good quality at affordable prices.

            <h2 class="bio-msg">Hey everyone, I'm hannah Wright.  I'm currently going into my senior year at Westwood High School. Volleyball is my life and you will always catch me on the court 
                playing with my school team or my club team. If I'm not on the court, I love to hang out with my friends either at Tempe Marketplace or watching movies. I love children and the joy they bring to my life. I have been 
                nannying for close to 3 years now and have loved every second of it. I started out with my cousins and my neighbors kids, but soon they started spreading the word and now I have become a successful business. I realized when a couple families tried to overpay me that 
                I noticed that nannies can be expensive. So that is why I charge an affordable price so families that can't afford expensive agency can rely on a good quality nanny to help them out.

                Nanny should be about tkaing car of the children and providing care so that the parents may 
                have a lighter load to carry.
