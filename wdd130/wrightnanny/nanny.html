            <h2>Over the years I have been nannying I have done many things to help ease the burden of parents who are looking for a night out free of worry. 
                some of the manythings include, feeding, playing, bathing and getting them tucked into bed so that you can come home to a nice and quiet house. And almost always I love to do a
                bit a tidying up while I'm watching the kids so don't be alarmed if you get the bonus of have a cleaner house than when you left, free of charge.

            <h2 class="skills-msg">This is Carson. I've lived down the street from his family for years, so i was overjoyed when Carson's parents asked me to come watch Carson for a couple hours one night. I got to 
                know carson so much more when i babysat him that night and had an absolute blast playiong games with him. He was a little sad when his parents got back and I had to leave, but I was super excited when his 
                parents asked if I could watch him evey week so they could have a date night. Getting to hang out with every week has brought an incredible joy into my life and has been an amazing help to his parents as well.

            <h2>This is my cousin Graysen. I've helped nanny him for going on 2 years now. He is 5 years old and is always excited when he finds out i get to come hang out with him for the evening.
                His favorite show is Spidey and Friends and he loves it when I take turns with his trains. My aunt never has to worry about her son going with out food or entertainment  because i will make them food, play with them and i'll even
                get them into bed, so their parents can enjoy a night out to themselves.
